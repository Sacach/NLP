This document contains the instructions for runnig each provided script
so that the results we obtained can be replicated

Each script is run from the command prompt


Task 1:
	- In the command prompt navigate to the folder containing the 
	  script
	- Type python task1.py
	- The script will display a plot, exit the plot to continue
	- The script will display the values of the linear fit curve 
	  and a plot, exit the plot to continue
	- The script outputs the estimation of number of samples outside
	  the confidence bound

Task 2:
	- In the command prompt navigate to the folder containing the 
	  script
	- Type python task2.py
	- The script will display a plot, exit the plot to continue
	- Type the word length to investigate further (2-8), other
	  inputs cause an error and you will have to run the script
	  again
	- The script will display the values of the linear fit curve 
	  and a plot, exit the plot to continue
	- The script outputs the estimation of number of samples outside
	  the confidence bound
	- Run multiple times to analyze different word lengths

Task 3:
	- In the command prompt navigate to the folder containing the 
	  script
	- Type python task3.py
	- The script will display a plot, exit the plot to continue
	- Type the pos tag to investigate further, other
	  inputs cause an error and you will have to run the script
	  again, capitalization does not matter
	- The script will display the values of the linear fit curve 
	  and a plot, exit the plot to continue
	- The script outputs the estimation of number of samples outside
	  the confidence bound
	- Run multiple times to analyze different pos tags

Task 4:
	- In the command prompt navigate to the folder containing the 
	  script
	- Type python task4.py
	- Processing takes several seconds, prgress is indicated
	- The script will display a plot, exit the plot to continue
	- Type the dialogue act tag to investigate further, other
	  inputs cause an error and you will have to run the script
	  again, capitalization does not matter
	- The script will display the values of the linear fit curve 
	  and a plot, exit the plot to continue
	- The script outputs the estimation of number of samples outside
	  the confidence bound
	- Run multiple times to analyze different dialogue act tags

Task 5:
	- In the command prompt navigate to the folder containing the 
	  script
	- Type python task5.py
	- Processing takes several seconds, prgress is indicated
	- The script will display some unique words from each age group
	- The script will display a wordcloud for each age group,
	  exit cloud to move to next image
	- The script will display the top 20 words from each age group

Tasks 6:
	- In the command prompt navigate to the folder containing the 
	  script
	- Type python task6_7.py
	- Input 's', without quotes, capitalization does not matter
	- Choose age group to analyze, capitalization does not matter,
	  invalid input will cause an error
	- The script will display the topic definiton and the coherence 		  of the topic definiton
	- Run multiple times to analyze different age groups

Task 7:
	- In the command prompt navigate to the folder containing the 
	  script
	- Type python task6_7.py
	- Input 'm', without quotes, capitalization does not matter
	- Choose two age groups to analyze, capitalization does not 	 	  matter, invalid input will cause an error
	- The script will display the topic definitons and the inter-	  group coherence of the topic definitions
	- Run multiple times to analyze different pairs age groups
Task 8:
	- In the command prompt navigate to the folder containing the 
	  script
	- Type python task8.py
	- Close the plots that open to continue running the code
Task 9:
	- In the command prompt navigate to the folder containing the 
	  script
	- Type python task9.py
Task 10:
	- In the command prompt navigate to the folder containing the 
	  script
	- Type python task10.py
